KaratSuba when the numbers are divided into 4 parts 
## 2. 
Suppose you are given an infinite chessboard with some blocked cells. A knight (which moves in an "L" shape) starts at position (0,0). Given a target position (x, y), determine the minimum number of moves required to reach the target (or return -1 if impossible).

## 3. 
**Sorting a Database of 10 BILLION** People (Name, Age, Salary, Country)
You have **10 billion records** where each person has:
	1. **Name** (String, up to 50 chars)
	2. **Age** (Integer, 0 to 120)
	3. **Salary** (Integer, 4 to 8 digits)
	4. **Country** (3-letter country code, e.g., `"USA"`, `"IND"`)
	
	Sort them in **this order**:  
	1️⃣ Country **(alphabetically)**  
	2️⃣ Age **(ascending)**  
	3️⃣ Salary **(descending)**  
	4️⃣ Name **(alphabetically)**

## 4. 
You are given N activities, each with a start time SiS_iSi and an end time EiE_iEi. However, each activity can have an overlapping penalty PiP_iPi (if scheduled alongside another overlapping activity). Modify the classic activity selection problem to minimize total penalty while maximizing the number of activities selected.
	•	Input: List of activities with Si,Ei,PiS_i, E_i, P_iSi,Ei,Pi
	•	Output: Maximum number of activities with the minimum penalty.
	-  Constraints : 1 <= N 10^5, 1 <= Si, Ei, Pi <= 10^9 
## 5.
A company releases a series of n collectible cards. Every time a customer buys a pack, they receive a single random card (each card is equally likely).Find the expected number of purchases required to collect all n cards.

## 6.
A gambler starts with "dollar A" and repeatedly bets "dollar 1" on a fair coin flip. If they win, they gain "dollar 1"; if they lose, they lose "dollar 1". The game stops when they reach "dollar B" or lose everything ($0$).
Find the expected number of bets until the game ends.
